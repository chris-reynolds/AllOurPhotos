#All Our Photos

This is supposed to be a trivial little exercise in dart.

It is to provide a webserver on an old desktop at home so we can upload
all out photos from different devices, sync with google photos, caption, rank and orient them.
Also provide support for scanning old photos and doing bulk captions and locations.
Also create albums that can be printed,uploaded to FB or synced with Google Photos

#back-end beginning to stablize.
